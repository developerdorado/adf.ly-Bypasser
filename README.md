# adf.ly-Bypasser
Adf.ly Bypasser it works specifically for when adf.ly wants to force you to allow notifications and then send you push advertising

What the extension does is detect adf.ly in the url regardless of the domain you are using
If this word is detected, the destination url to which you would be redirected if you allow notifications is subtracted, it is decoded and redirected, all this in 1 second.

This extension is basic and for personal use and I have decided to share it.
This extension works for all browsers that use chromium technology
